This project predicts the likelihood of individuals receiving the xyz and seasonal flu vaccines using machine learning models. The project includes data loading, handling missing data, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and modeling. Five different models were tested: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC). The final models provide probability predictions for both vaccines.
